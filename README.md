# Tourney Manager

## Intro

Tourney Manager is a very simple web app for tournament organizers to make and publish tournaments. Once logged in, you can see tournaments that have been created and also create your own.

## Getting started

[Click here to open the website (opens on current page)](https://tourmanager.herokuapp.com/)

An account is required to create and see all the tournaments on the website. Account creation and credentialing is done using JWT. Once logged in, users can create a tournament, delete their tournament, and update details of their tournament.
